- In your template (.html) file add component selector tags found in componentname.component.ts

Data passage example:
- Recipe constructed in the recipe-list component

- Recipe information called in recipe-detail component (@Input() takes any information emitted)
  - Also displayed on recipe.html so it has access to the information emitted
  - Formats information on its frontend, which is displayed on recipes template
- Recipe constructed displayed on recipes template (which is displayed on the app template)
