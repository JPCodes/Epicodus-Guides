  Starting a project with a DB (Terminal)
  - psql (Terminal)
  - CREATE DATABASE db_name ( <- Create a database with the name of your choice)
  - CREATE TABLE table_name (id serial PRIMARY KEY, parameter varchar) (( <- Create your tables ))
  - CREATE DATABASE db_name_test WITH TEMPLATE db_name (Create a test version of this DB for your specs)
  Next (app.rb)
  - require('pg') ((In your app.rb))
    - DB = PG.connect({:dbname => "db_name"}) ((Link your app.rb to a your DB))
  
  Tips for working on a project
  - When you add a new column to your DB, delete your test DB and remake it with the same Schema
  - Use a spec_helper.rb file that will have repeated code like the code that deletes the test database each spec run
    - require('spec_helper') ((In your app.rb))

  - List all databases: \l
  - Connect to database: \c database_name
  - List tables in current database: \dt
  - List columns in a table: \d table_name
  - Exit out of help menu: \q
  - See a list of all psql commands: \? (Press the down arrow to scroll through, or q to exit list.)
