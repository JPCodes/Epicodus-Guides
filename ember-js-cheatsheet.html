  Key:
  Display == Template == Views
  Behavior == JS File || Route Handler (Note: JS File has a dash[-], while a Route Handler JS file will not)
    
  Generating Routes and Templates:
  - $ ember generate route about
    - Creates: app/routes/about.js (route handler)
    - Creates: app/templates/about.hbs (template)
  
  Generating Components and Templates:
  - $ ember generate component rental-tile
    - Creates: app/components/rental-tile.js (js file for component; behavior)
    - Creates: app/templates/components/rental-tile.hbs (component; display)
  
  Purpose of Each File (same name shows they correspond to each other):
  - app/templates/file.hbs (Display) (Template)
    - app/routes/file.js (Route Handler File) (Actions, Model Hooks go here)
  - app/templates/components/file.hbs (Hold a piece of display code for corresponding template) (Template-component)
    - app/components/file-something.js (Hold a piece of behavioral code for corresponding template-component) (Template-component-behavior)
  
  Components:
  - Component consists of two parts (Display and Behavior): A Handlebars template that defines the display (app/templates/components/rental-tile.hbs) A JavaScript source file that defines how it will behave (app/components/rental-tile.js).
  - Components are isolated and do not automatically have access to models and other information within context of the route in which they are called. Anything a component needs from its surroundings must be passed in manually (from its behavior file).
  - Example Format in a Component's display file {{component-file rental-in-component=rental-from-template}}
  - Template File Example {{#each model as |rental-from-template|}}{{rental-tile rental-in-component=rental-from-template}}
